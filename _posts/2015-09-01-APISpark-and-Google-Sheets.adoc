APISpark can be used as a free cloud-based database to serve up
interactive data stored in Google Sheets and display the data in
 simple web pages hosted on GitHub Pages. The APISpark Google Sheets wrapper
 is the easiest way to start to use APISpark.

In this example, a high school student created a web site to store a media list
of student work. The list is updated in one of three ways:

. Everyone can submit content by filling in boxes in a Google Form.  The Google
Form automatically updates the Google Sheet.
. Editors can write directly to the Google Sheet after the administrator gives write access to their Google Account.
. Adminstrators can use the API, most likely through a web interface that the front-end developer configures.


To prototype usability, the student created a GitHub Pages site using a free Bootstrap template. By using pre-made templates, interface and design can be finished in an hour.
